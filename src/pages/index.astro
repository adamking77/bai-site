            When your business model stops fitting your actual capabilities, lifestyle, or values, you don't just have a strategy problem - you have an intelligence problem.

          <p class="text-lg font-light text-foreground/70 leading-relaxed">
            Most people try to solve this by working harder, hiring consultants, or adopting more "best practices." But that's like using a map of Paris to navigate Tokyo.

          <p class="text-lg font-light text-foreground/70 leading-relaxed">
            You need systematic intelligence about what's actually constraining your autonomy, plus proven frameworks for designing something that works with your reality instead of against it.
